#Information on the file

List of values in the column Country

```{r}
unique(catch83$Country)
```

List of values in the column area

```{r}
unique(catch83$Division)
```

The list of values interesting for our research are the areas surrounding Great Britain. The list can be found here.

The interesting values are:
Northern North Sea: IV a
Central North Sea: 27.4.b

# Who is fishing what

For which area, which countries are fishing the most in each area?
```{r}
install.packages("sqldf")
library(sqldf)
```

Extract the data for each area and export them in a csv file

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "IV a"
      GROUP BY Country')
```

Export the data for the area IV a or 27.4.a in a csv file.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "IV a"
      GROUP BY Country'), "83Area274a.csv")
```

Export the data for the other areas.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "IV b"
      GROUP BY Country'), "83Area274b.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "IV c"
      GROUP BY Country'), "83Area274c.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "VI a"
      GROUP BY Country'), "83Area276a.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "VII a"
      GROUP BY Country'), "83Area277a.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "VII d"
      GROUP BY Country'), "83Area277d.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "VII e"
      GROUP BY Country'), "83Area277e.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "VII f"
      GROUP BY Country'), "83Area277f.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "VII g"
      GROUP BY Country'), "83Area277g.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Area = "VII h"
      GROUP BY Country'), "83Area277h.csv")
```

# Analysis by country

We can see that in 1983, waters surrounding Britain were already majorly fished by by other countries. This has been taken into account later for the attribution of the quotas.
So where were british vessels fishing at the time?

## Britain

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Country = "UK"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(year1983) DESC')
```

Extract the data.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Country = "UK"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(year1983) DESC'), "83UKbyarea.csv")
```

Compare with other main fishing countries.

## France

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Country = "France"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(year1983) DESC')
```
Extract the data.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Country = "France"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(year1983) DESC'), "83Francebyarea.csv")
```

## Spain

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Country = "Spain"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(year1983) DESC')

```

Extract data.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Country = "Spain"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(year1983) DESC'), "83Spainbyarea.csv")
```

## Netherlands

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Country = "Netherlands"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(year1983) DESC')
```

Extract data.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(year1983) FROM catch83
      WHERE Country = "Netherlands"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(year1983) DESC'), "83Spainbyarea.csv")
```
