List of values in the column species

```{r}
unique(catchtoday$Species)
```
There is a high number of species. We will concentrate only on the most important ones.

The list of values interesting for our research are the areas surrounding Great Britain. The list can be found here.
https://mare.istc.cnr.it/fisheriesv2/area_en?code=27
The interesting values are:
Northern North Sea: 27.4.a
Central North Sea: 27.4.b
Southern North Sea: 27.4.c
Northwest Coast of Scotland: 27.6.a
Irish Sea: 27.7.a
Eastern English Channel: 27.7.d
Western English Channel: 27.7.e
Bristol Channel: 27.7.f
Celtic Sea North: 27.7.g
Celtic Sea South: 27.7.h

#Which species are the most caught in each area

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Area, Species, SUM(year2018) as Catch2018 FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.4.a"
      GROUP BY Species
      ORDER BY Catch2018 DESC')
```
Export the data for the Area 27.4.a

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Species, SUM(year2018) as Catch2018 FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.4.a"
      GROUP BY Species
      ORDER BY Catch2018 DESC'), "Species274a.csv")
```

Export the data for the other areas.

```{r}

      WHERE Area = "27.4.b"
