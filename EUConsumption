## Importing the files

Importing the data.

```{r}
fishconso <- read.csv("Eumofa_consumption.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, sep=";", header=T)
```

Extracting the year 2020

```{r}
twentyfishconso <- subset(fishconso, fishconso$year == 2020)
```

## Finding the countries with the higher fish consumption

Install the SQL package.

```{r}
install.packages("sqldf")
library(sqldf)
```

Order the countries by their consumption of fish.

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT country, cast(sum(value_EUR) as int) as value_EUR FROM twentyfishconso
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY value_EUR DESC')
```

Extract the data

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT country, cast(sum(value_EUR) as int) as value_EUR FROM twentyfishconso
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY value_EUR DESC'), "Consumptionbycountry.csv")
```

## Comparing the nature of the consumption

Let's take the three biggest consumer of fish (Spain, Italy, France) and compare their consumption with the UK.

# Create a dataframe for each country

```{r}
spainfishconso <- subset(twentyfishconso, twentyfishconso$country == "Espagne")

francefishconso <- subset(twentyfishconso, twentyfishconso$country == "France")

italyfishconso <- subset(twentyfishconso, twentyfishconso$country == "Italie")

UKfishconso <- subset(twentyfishconso, twentyfishconso$country == "Royaume-Uni")
```

#Extract the data

```{r}
write.csv(spainfishconso, "spainfishconso2020.csv")

write.csv(francefishconso, "francefishconso2020.csv")

write.csv(italyfishconso, "italyfishconso2020.csv")

write.csv(UKfishconso, "UKfishconso2020.csv")
```
