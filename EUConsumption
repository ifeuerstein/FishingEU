## Importing the files

Importing the data.

```{r}
fishconso <- read.csv("Eumofa_consumption.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, sep=";", header=T)
```

Install the SQL package.

```{r}
install.packages("sqldf")
library(sqldf)
```

## Finding the countries with the higher fish consumption


Order the countries by their consumption of fish.

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT country, cast(avg(value_EUR) as int) as value_EUR FROM fishconso
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY value_EUR DESC')
```

Extract the data

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT country, cast(avg(value_EUR) as int) as value_EUR FROM fishconso
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY value_EUR DESC'), "Consumptionbycountry.csv")
```


## Comparing the nature of the consumption

# Calculate the average consumtion 2013-2020 by species for the main countries

Let's take the three biggest consumer of fish (Spain, Italy, France) and compare their consumption with the UK.

Create a subset for each country.

```{r}
Spainfishconso <- subset(fishconso, fishconso$country == "Espagne")

Francefishconso <- subset(fishconso, fishconso$country == "France")

Italyfishconso <- subset(fishconso, fishconso$country == "Italie")

UKfishconso <- subset(fishconso, fishconso$country == "Royaume-Uni")
```

Calculate an average by specie

```{r}
Spainaverage <- sqldf('SELECT country, specie, AVG(value_EUR) FROM Spainfishconso
GROUP BY specie
ORDER BY AVG(value_EUR) DESC')

Franceaverage <- sqldf('SELECT country, specie, AVG(value_EUR) FROM Francefishconso
GROUP BY specie
ORDER BY AVG(value_EUR) DESC')

Italyaverage <- sqldf('SELECT country, specie, AVG(value_EUR) FROM Italyfishconso
GROUP BY specie
ORDER BY AVG(value_EUR) DESC')

UKaverage <- sqldf('SELECT country, specie, AVG(value_EUR) FROM UKfishconso
GROUP BY specie
ORDER BY AVG(value_EUR) DESC')
```

# Combining the files

```{r}
maincountriesaverage <- rbind(Spainaverage, Franceaverage, Italyaverage, UKaverage)
```

#Extracting the files

```{r}
write.csv(maincountriesaverage, "consumptionmaincountries.csv")
```
