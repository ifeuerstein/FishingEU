Sum of the total catch

```{r}
sum(catchtoday$X2018)
```


# Who is fishing what

For which area, which countries are fishing the most in each area?
```{r}
install.packages("sqldf")
library(sqldf)
```

Extract the data for each area and export them in a csv file

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.4.a"
      GROUP BY Country')
```

Export the data for the area 27.4.a in a csv file.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.4.a"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area274a.csv")
```

Export the data for the other areas.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.4.b"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area274b.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.4.c"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area274c.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.6.a"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area276a.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.7.a"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area277a.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.7.d"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area277d.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.7.e"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area277e.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.7.f"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area277f.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.7.g"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area277g.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.7.h"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area277h.csv")

# Analysis by country

In 1983, waters surrounding Britain were already majorly fished by by other countries. Where are the other countries fishing today? 

## Britain

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(X2018) FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Country = "GB"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(X2018) DESC')
```

Extract the data.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(X2018) FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Country = "GB"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(X2018) DESC'), "2018UKbyarea.csv")
```

Compare with other main fishing countries.

## France

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(X2018) FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Country = "FR"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(X2018) DESC')
```
Extract the data.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(X2018) FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Country = "FR"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(X2018) DESC'), "2018Francebyarea.csv")
```

## Spain

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(X2018) FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Country = "ES"
      GROUP BY Area
      ORDER BY SUM(X2018) DESC')

```

Extract data.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT Area, Country, SUM(X2018) FROM catchtoday
