```{r}
install.packages("sqldf")
library(sqldf)
```

Extract the data for each area and export them in a csv file

```{r}
sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.4.a"
      GROUP BY Country')
```

Export the data for the area 27.4.a in a csv file.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.4.a"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area274a.csv")
```

Export the data for the other areas.

```{r}
write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.4.b"
      GROUP BY Country'), "Area274b.csv")

write.csv(sqldf('SELECT SUM(X2018), Country, Area FROM catchtoday
      WHERE Area = "27.4.c"
